    "Two competing philosophies on statistics have sparked debates. These two approaches, frequentist and Bayesian, differ in how they treat probabilities and statistical inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "A frequentist assigns probabilities to data rather than hypotheses, focusing on the long-run frequency of events. In this framework, any collected data set is viewed as one of many hypothetical data sets that addresses the same question. Uncertainty arises solely from sampling error. Confidence intervals, therefore, are constructed to contain the true parameter a specific percentage of the time when the experiment is repeated infinitely often. As the number of repetitions increases, the influence of false outliers diminishes, and the statistical methods are designed to perform reliably under such repeatable conditions. Probability is treated the same as frequency. The likelihood of an event is defined by its relative frequency in infinite repetitions of the same experiment. Importantly, in the frequentist perspective, the true parameters of a probability model are treated as fixed values. This implies that probabilistic statements about these parameters are invalid. An event occuring is either true or false, with no intermediate probabilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, Bayesians assign probabilities to hypotheses, viewing probabilities as degrees of belief. From the Bayesian perspective, a probability is given to a hypothesis. The parameter is taken as a random variable. This means that there is a probability the event will occur. This perspective allows for probabilistic statements about unknown parameters even before any data is observed, with probabilities ranging from 0% to 100%. An important difference is that Bayesian inference takes prior knowledge into account. The prior probability reflects beliefs about a parameter before data is collected, and Bayesian statistics is designed to update these beliefs in response to new evidence. By incorporating prior knowledge, Bayesian models refine the probabilities of hypotheses as more data becomes available.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases, Bayesian methods closely resemble other statistical approaches, especially when working with large samples from a fixed model. For smaller sample sizes, many conventional methods can be understood as approximations to Bayesian inferences based on specific prior distributions. Recognizing the implicit priors in these methods can provide valuable insights into their assumptions. However, some methods, like hypothesis testing, may yield results that differ significantly from those obtained using Bayesian approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of the different approaches of frequentists and Bayesians is in the medical field when you want to diagnose a patient. In the frequentist approach, the doctor would look at the current complaints the patient has and compare that to previous records of other patients with similar pains and what their diagnosis was to hopefully get a diagnosis for the current patient. In the Bayesian approach, the doctor would also take the patient's previous medical records into account. This means that they will also consider prior knowledge for a diagnosis. \n",
    "\n",
    "In astronomy, marganilisation is often used to account for uncertainties in parameters. For example, let's say we have observed the magnitudes of stars within a cluster and we want to determine the distance to a star using the distance modulus\n",
    "$$ m - M = 5 log_{10}(d) - 5 $$\n",
    "$m$ is the apparent magnitude, $M$ the absolute magnitude and $d$ the distance. In practise $m$ and $M$ will have uncertainties.\n",
    "A frequentist might directly try to fit $d$ to the observed magnitudes using the model. Often they will assume a fixed $M$ (or its mean value). This does not take into account the uncertainties in $M$, leading to an overconfidence of estimates. A Bayesian will calculate the posterior probability distribution for the distance, marganilising over $M$. \n",
    "$$ P(d|m) = \\int P(d, M|m)dM = \\int P(m|d,M)P(d)P(M)dM $$\n",
    "$P(m|d,M)$ is the likelihood of observing $m$ given $d$ and $M$, $P(d)$ is a prior on the distance and $P(M)$ a prior on the absolute magnitude. This now accounts for all possible values. \n",
    "\n",
    "The debate between frequentism and Bayesianism often revolves around the use of priors, which frequentists criticize for introducing potential biases into analysis. Despite this critique, Bayesian methods are widely regarded as reasonable if the chosen prior is sensible. This will be explained further in [**Chapter 5**](https://bayesian-statistics-for-astrophysics-2024.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lecture_notes/group5/group5.html)\n",
