    "A hypothesis is a statement regarding a population parameter. The hypothesis test is used to make a decision, based on a sample from the population, which of the hypotheses is true; either the *Null hypothesis* or the *Alternative hypothesis*. \n",
    "\n",
    "The null hypothesis is the default assumption that there is no relationship between two measured phenomena and is denoted as $H_0$. The alternative hypothesis is the complement of the null hypothesis and is denoted as $H_1$. Let us note this in a more formal mathematical manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\theta$ denote the hypothesis and let us partition the parameter space $\\Theta$ into two complementary sets, $\\Theta_0$ and $\\Theta_1$, such that $\\Theta_0$+$\\Theta_1$=$\\Theta$. The hypothesis test tests\n",

    "One of the most popular ways to communicate uncertainty is through *confidence intervals*. The idea is to find an interval around the estimated value $\\hat\\theta$ that covers the true value $\\theta^*$. We characterize the confidence interval through the *confidence level* $\\gamma$. A $\\gamma$-confidence interval has a probability of atleast $\\gamma$ that the interval $(\\hat\\theta_l,\\hat\\theta_r)$ contains the true parameter $\\theta^*$, or in mathematical terms: \\begin{equation} P(\\theta^*\\in(\\hat\\theta_l,\\hat\\theta_r)\\geqq\\gamma \\end{equation} It is important to understand that it is not the variable $\\theta^*$ that has a probability of $\\gamma$ to be in the interval (\\hat\\theta_l,\\hat\\theta_r), but rather the chance that the confidence interval has a probability $\\gamma$ to include the true value $\\theta^*$. It is thus not the true value that is random but rather the confidence interval is the one that changes.\n",
