    "## Computation of confidence intervals using a grid search\n",
    "Computing confidence intervals using a grid search is a method particularly useful when analytic solutions are unavailable. By evaluating the parameter space, calculating posterior probabilities for every point, and deriving credible intervals we get a confidence interval given the data and prior knowledge such that P[Θ ∈ I | X] = 1−α where alpha is our confidence level. In this manner  it is an analogue to a frequentist confidence interval.\n",

    "By first creating a fine grid of plausible values for our parameters and defining a posterior, following bayesian inference, we can compute the value of the posterior in each point. Meaning that every combination of n parameters is used to calculate the posterior giving a hypercube filled with **m_1 \\cdot m_2 \\cdot ... \\cdot m_n** points. (for ** m_i** the total number of chosen grid values).\n",

    "\n",
    "To identify the confidence interval we have two main methods. For symmetric distributions we look at an equal tail approximation. The interval [θ(α/2),θ(1−α/2)] determines the region where all points lay such the probability for a point to lay in this interval is 1- alpha. This reflects the true probability the value of our parameter lies in that interval. However this brings some ambiguity into play. Imagine a simple gaussian distribution. we can construct a alpa =0.5 interval on the left side going from -inf to the mean or an interval on the right side. we can also have the mean in the middle of the interval and symmetrically go to both side. To solve this ambivalence we try to minimize the length of the interval. Or let the interval be determined by equalling the excluded area on both tail-ends.\n",
